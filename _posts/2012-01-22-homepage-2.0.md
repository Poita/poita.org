Well, I've done it again. New website from scratch.

This time, I've gone for simplicity. I got sick of the incredible bloat
of Joomla and all its features that were unnecessary for what I wanted
to achieve: an essentially static website that I can easily configure.

This time, I've gone with [Tom Preston-Werner][1]'s excellent [jekyll][2]
static site generator. I just write my posts in Markdown, run jekyll, and
it generates all the HTML for me. I have full control over the layout of
the site, and everything is there in plain text.

The source for this site is [hosted on GitHub][3].
